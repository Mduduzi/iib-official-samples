## Samples
The IBMÂ® Integration Toolkit provides samples that show the features that are available in IBM Integration Bus, and how to use them. This topic provides links to the information about the individual samples.

Use the samples to learn how to use IBM Integration Bus.

You can view information about samples only when you use the product documentation that is integrated with the IBM Integration Toolkit or the online product documentation. You can run samples only when you use the product documentation that is integrated with the IBM Integration Toolkit.

Not all samples work in all modes. If you try to use a sample in a mode that is restricted, you receive a message indicating the reason; see Restrictions that apply in each operation mode. You can run all samples in a development and unit test broker; see Development and unit test.

The samples are categorized as either Application or Technology samples.
